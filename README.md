**Educational repository for building an AI-powered gaming environment using Three.js, AWS services, OpenAI API, and FAISS vector store.**

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to combine various technologies to create an interactive AI-driven gaming environment, leveraging:

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript 3D library for rendering graphics and creating 3D environments.
- **AWS Services**: To manage infrastructure, storage, and scaling.
- **OpenAI API**: For integrating language models (LLMs) to enhance interaction with AI.
- **FAISS Vector Store**: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, used here for AI decision-making and environment control.

## Key Features

- Real-time 3D rendering using Three.js.
- Integration with AWS services to handle game infrastructure and data pipelines.
- AI-driven interactions powered by OpenAI's language models.
- Efficient vector search with FAISS for decision-making in the gaming environment.
